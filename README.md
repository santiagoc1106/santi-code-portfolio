# Santi's code portfolio

    Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will talk about all of my previous projects throughout my journey in Cannon's computer science course.

    I started my journey with Cannon's intro course, Honors C+CS, which began with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Most, if not all, of my projects started here at Khan Academy. The project I'm most proud of during that time is my final exam, my website, which is linked here: https://resilient-crumble-e5fec2.netlify.app/evite. The link to the code is here: https://github.com/santiagoc1106/santi.

    Moving on to the start of my AP journey in computer science, I started with a card game. I chose to do Blackjack, given it was the most simple card game I could think of at the time.
