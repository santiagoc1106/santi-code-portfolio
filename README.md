# Santi's code portfolio

    Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will talk about all of my previous projects throughout my journey in Cannon's computer science course.

    I started my journey with Cannon's intro course, "C+CS", which started with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Most, if not all, of my projects started here at Khan Academy. The project I'm most proud of during that time is my final exam, my website, which is linked here: https://resilient-crumble-e5fec2.netlify.app/evite. The link to the code is here: https://github.com/santiagoc1106/santi.
