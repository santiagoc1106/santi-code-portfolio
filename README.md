# Santi's code portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will talk about all of my previous projects throughout my journey in Cannon's computer science course.

    I started my journey with Cannon's intro course, Honors C+CS, which began with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Most, if not all, of my projects started here at Khan Academy. The project I'm most proud of during that time is my final exam, my website, which is linked here: https://resilient-crumble-e5fec2.netlify.app/evite. The link to the code is here: https://github.com/santiagoc1106/santi. This project challenged me and made me realize how hard actual coding projects are. It was fun, and I am proud to see how far I've come.

    Moving on to the start of my AP journey in computer science, I started with a card game. I chose to do Blackjack, given it was the most simple card game I could think of then. I coded this with JavaScript and HTML; it was the first project I had to do independently. The link to the code is here: https://github.com/santiagoc1106/game. The link to the game itself is here: https://astounding-dango-aea8c0.netlify.app/. This project helped me grow in problem-solving as well as being efficient in my own work. This means I had to figure out why things broke and also finding shortcuts when needed. 

    My first in-class project was coding a Discord bot and this was also my first Python project. This project was the project that made me fall in love with Python. I went through learning what a venv was and how to use the terminal properly and a bunch of other things. The bot I made was made to play music whenever you're in the same voice chat as it and it takes links from YouTube to grab the audio file and play it using ffempeg. The link to the code is here: https://github.com/santiagoc1106/new-bot-code.
